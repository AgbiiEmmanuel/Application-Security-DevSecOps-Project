# Application Security Assessment README

## Overview
This document outlines the methodology and objectives for conducting application security assessments within the company. The process includes conducting a critical asset list, followed by in-depth analysis and implementation of security measures for one selected application.

## Reason for Conducting Application Security Assessments
Application security assessments are crucial for safeguarding sensitive data, ensuring regulatory compliance, and fortifying defenses against cyber threats. By identifying vulnerabilities and implementing robust security measures, the company can effectively mitigate risks and bolster its overall cybersecurity posture.

## Process

**Critical Asset List**: Conduct a comprehensive critical asset list for three applications to identify and prioritize key assets within the company's infrastructure.

**Selection of Focus Application**: Choose one application for detailed analysis and security enhancement based on the critical asset list findings.

**Data Flow Diagram and High-Level Diagram**: Develop detailed data flow diagrams and high-level architectural diagrams to visualize the application's infrastructure and data flow patterns.

**Threat Modeling**: Employ tools such as MITRE ATT&CK and other threat modeling techniques to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities throughout the application's lifecycle.
Inherent Risk Assessment: Perform an inherent risk assessment to evaluate the initial risk level associated with the selected application, considering its vulnerabilities and potential impact.

**Cyber Kill Chain**: Formulate a Cyber Attack Kill Chain to delineate the stages of a potential cyber attack and identify potential points of intervention and defense.

**AWS EC2 Infrastructure Diagram**: Create an AWS EC2 infrastructure diagram, detailing the region, VPC, subnet, security group, and Elastic Block Store (EBS) configuration to ensure a secure cloud environment.

**Security Measures Implementation**: Design and implement a range of security measures, including access controls, encryption mechanisms, intrusion detection systems, and incident response plans, to enhance the application's security posture.
